Version 0.24  - Add URI field to all quantities. URI will be used to represent 
 Sep-19-2006	the semantic value of each quantity.
 
Version 0.23  - Move to ObjectWithQuanities instead of "Quantity/CompositeQuantity".
 Aug-29-2006

Version 0.21  - Improve installation instructions. 
 Jul-16-2006  - Add in Doxygen file for running it to document the project.

Version 0.20  - Add in some equivalence check to various datatypes (very buggy).
 Jul-08-2006  
 (internal)

Version 0.13  - Refactor classes into sub-packages for greater managability.
 Jul-05-2006    Now we have sub-packages of 'app', 'core', 'datatype', 'locator',
 (internal)     'support', 'support.handler', 'support.DOMXerces2' and 'units'.

Version 0.12  - Add JUnit tests 
 Jul-01-2006  - Fix bug in XMLSerialiableObj...not handling FIELD_CHILD_NODE_LIST_TYPE correctly.
 (internal)   - Remove Crimson classes..its just too hard to continue to adapt older package
 		to new DOM 2+ standard in Java5 world (which seems to enforce it by default).

Version 0.11  - Change to maven2 build structure.
 Jun-30-2006  - Switch to Log4J from specialized logger.
 (internal)   

Version 0.10  - Add in partial Xerces2 DOM support, works with Java 1.4 and Java 1.5 
 Nov-09-2005    (no JAXP DocumentBuilder/Factory support currently)
              - Make test procedure a little less chatty.
              - Add support for testing either/both Crimson/Xerces DOM support. (Note: Crimson 
                support only works with Java 1.4 as Java 1.5 interfaces have DOM lvl 2,3 which 
                crimson doesn't support).
              - Add in compilerargs, better build support for different configurations to build.xml

Version 0.05  - Added ability to handle generic DOM elements with simple/mixed content.
 Aug-04-2005  - Added ability to handle the common xsd:string, xsd:anyURI content types 
                in Qelements. Number types need further consideration... should we force
                these (implicitly) into Q's -or- QElements (currently, they are dropped :P)
              - Fix schema inheritance interpretation problem with mixed child nodes. 
                Basically, we now have 2 'default' chardata handlers is being used.
                One ignores all charData, the other doesnt. In the case where the parent 
                node uses the default (ignore) Chardata handler, but a child node has 
                set the 'mixed' attribute to 'true' the child now uses the correct non-ignore
                handler.

Version 0.04  - Fix anyAttribute in Q to be "##any" namespace rather than "##other"
 Jul-30-2005    as this caused problems in some inheriting schema.
              - Tweek error reporting for QMLELementImpl in DOMCrimson
              - Fix bug in auto-generation of prefix table for inheriting schema. The
                root node, if default namespace, was not picked up. QML namespace 
                should not automatically be added (a prior hack/workaround now dropped).
              - Fix (philosophical) bug: QMLELementImpl for DOMCrimson package constructor
                w/o namespaceURI should default to QML_NAMESPACE_URI value.
              - Fix bug : inheriting schema need to invoke QuantityType (abstract type)
                for purposes of substitution groups, however, parser then looks for a handler.
                Added QUANTITY nodeType and Illegal{Start|End|CharData} handlers so that
                the minor error message is no longer thrown. 
              - Tone down warning in XMLSerializableField...its OK to have a null object.
              - Fix bug in namespace setting...if a node used default "" prefix, the namespace
                was not always being set properly by the document parser
              - Tone down some debuging inforamtion from the Documentparser by making some
                information at the 'info' rather than 'debug' level. This will allow for some
                meaningfull information to be seen without the full blast of verbage from a parse.
              - Improve schema storage, remove reduntant storage in samples dir

Version 0.03  - Add AxisFrame interface [moves AxisFrame.java to AxisFrameImpl.java]
 Aug-05-2004    Bug fix : addAxis in AxisFrame should check for ListQuantity.
                Bug fix : init from mapping in AtomicQ needs separate init method
                Bug fix : remove sys.err.println calls in Log (reminder: replace with Log4J!)
                Add ant doxygen documentation generation task

Version 0.02  - Fix to build.xml so that tests may be run if CLASSPATH lacks "." path
 Jul-28-2004    Clean up bulid.xml file so that use more patternset directives
                Do the QML document handler better..split of function handlers into separate
                   files in child package "handlers".
                Add methods to QMLDocument for better access to namespaceURI/prefix mappings 
                "Reverse" the namespaceURI/prefix methods..user shouldnt care what prefix actually
                   is, its the namespaceURI for a class which is important.
                Fix QML schema..allow "anyAttribute" on Quantities so inheriting schema may
                   expand upon attributes available.
                Fix so that prefix separator ":" is not shown if element has prefix of
                "zero" size/length.
                Add mapping constructor to mappingQ class so that inheriting classes may
                override it, if desired.
                Improved load tests to validate secondary loaded output
                Bug fix: vanilla/default handlers for elements not properly assigned for inheriting
                   schema 
                For now, DONT allow components to have Q's as meta-data. This makes them look like 
                    Composite Q's. Force such meta-data to have to be placed in the parent Q.
                Fix schema so that refQ's may be in altValues list.
                Bug fix: allow QMLDocumentHandler to load defs from *included* schema (previously
                    only loaded imported schema only) 

Version 0.01  - Initial version!
