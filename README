  Quanity Modelling Language (QML)
  --------------------------------

  First off: thanks for taking a look at QML. I bet you are wondering 
  what "QML" is, eh? Ok, here's a quick shot at defining it: 

     QML is a "thing"-based language for scientific and 
     mathematical data modeling. Each "thing" is a "quantity" which 
     is be associated with a structure and a semantic definition..which
     for our purposes is a physical phenomena (like "star" or 
     "fluid temperature"). It has much in common with ontology-based 
     languages like OWL/RDF but is streamlined to just focus on percieved 
     needs in science data modeling and data serialization for archiving
     and transport.

  Second, this software consitutes a research effort/interest by myself
  and this software is not guarrenteed to be complete or fit for any 
  purpose whatsoever. As it happens, I would consider this package to
  currently be "alpha" (see the TODO file for missing things). Certainly
  there may also be some significant bugs and some existing features may 
  break from version to version. The majority of my effort is to test 
  ideas and add planned features from the development roadmap; stability 
  will come afterwards.

  Third, if you just want to install this and run it, proceed directly 
  to the "INSTALL" file.

  I am very open to contributions and development help. Please contact me 
  if you are interested.

  Lastly, as a notice to my employers, and whomever else is concerned:

  While this work overlaps heavily with my professional interests
  in Grid computing and the Virtual Observatory, the package was
  wholly developed on my own time, away from work. I did this, not
  because I wished to annoy my wife (which I did do), but because 
  I wanted this package to be free and clear of any institutional
  entanglements/licensing problems.

  As a result, this package is licensed under the Lessor GNU Public
  License (LGPL) so that it may be used by the broadest audience
  possible. When you are using/hacking/modifying this package, all 
  that I ask is that if you develop a good patch, to let be know 
  about it so that it might be incorporated within QML.

  This package (and my work on QML) is dedicated to my Mother, 
  Freida Ann Thomas, who passed away from cancer while I was working 
  on the early versions of it. I love and miss you very much mom.
