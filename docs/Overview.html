QML Package Overview. 
<p>
The QML (Quantity Modeling Language) Java package comprises a "Core"
package which may be used to read/write/manipulate QML objects/files
and several QML::DOM packages which allow read/write/manipulation of
XML documents which embed one or more QML elements. The QML::DOM
packages are named according to the particular underlying DOM implementation 
that they inherit from. You do not need more than one of these QML::DOM
packages in order to get the QML::DOM functionality.
