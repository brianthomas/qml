     INSTALLATION of QML package

	1. Preamble

	This package is designed for use under Java 1.4 and 1.5. To use 1.4, you will
	need to acquire the regex packages. Not sure what additional library support
	you will need to run with 1.3 or earlier, its best to stick with more modern
	versions.


	2. Building it.

	The good news is thats is *way* easier to build and test now. This is because
	I have switched the project over to 'maven' (version 2) build system, which 
	may be downloaded for various platforms from :
	
		http://maven.apache.com

	Be sure to get a version of 2.0.2 or later.

	After you have installed maven, then it is trival to build the package, use
	the lifecycle target 'install', e.g.

	> mvn install

	From the top level of the directory. Other targets of interest are 'compile',
	'jar' and 'test' which are self-explanitory. Maven also nicely builds the
	project files for eclipse, so you may want to run "eclipse:eclipse" target
	and then use 'import files' in eclipse to see the project that way. 

	Now, for the intrepid, or the masocists out there, I have retained the 
	old ANT build.xml file (as build.xml.orig). I DONT SUPPORT THIS AND YOU ARE
	ON YOUR OWN (IT WONT WORK 'OUT OF THE BOX'). I strongly suggest you download
	maven and use that (!).


	Good Luck!
